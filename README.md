## Notes

I have some experience with Javascript, HTML and CSS, but I have not tried to work on PHP. I found PHP
to be more messy and hard to manipulate than Javascript, especially when I want to enclose one within another.
Therefore, I have spent a lot of time on looking at the tutorials and do trial and errors on the project.
To be honest, my code is not well organized, but I will try my best to polish it.
